# Pomodoro Clock
This is a Pomodoro clock created as per the instructions on freeCodeCamp for the legacy Front End Developer Certificate. The app allows the user to choose a session and break length in minutes and once started will cycle back and forth between sessions and breaks until paused or reset.

There is a working version of this repo at the following link: [Pomodoro Clock](https://codepen.io/noctearmy/pen/deWadd)
